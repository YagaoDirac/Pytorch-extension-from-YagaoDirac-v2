ddnn uses mig. I copied the code from mig into the ddnn file.
The pure code will be in a big one.
Now im considering, maybe I should provide the combination (mig) as example. Maybe people want "mirror sigmoid gramo". But mig is "mirror gramo", it implicitely tells people not to add anything in between mirror and gramo, which looks not very correctly.
